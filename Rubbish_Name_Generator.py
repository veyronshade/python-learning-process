print("Welcome to the Rubbish Name Generator")
first_name = input("What's your name?\n")

second_name = input("What's the name of something you really love doing?\n")

print("You are " + first_name + " and You Love " + second_name)
print("Hurray!!! Your Rubbish Name is ready")
input("Type Yes to get the result\n")
